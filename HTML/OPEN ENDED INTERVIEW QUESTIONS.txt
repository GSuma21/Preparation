->Why do coding standards matter? What are some patterns you follow?

         Coding standards are collections of rules and guidelines that determine the programming style,
          procedures, and methods for a programming language.
         Without the coding conventions, every individual in a team will settle their coding styles. 
         It will not be easy to maintain and debug the code in the near future.
      
        Benefits of coding standards

                Easy team integration
                Increased code quality efficiency and easy for maintaining
                Reduce code complexity
                Reduce development cost

                         Formatting and Indentation
